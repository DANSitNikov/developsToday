# Description

## Instruction
* Clone this repository or just download it
* Open test folder and install dependencies
* After that, in terminal you can write 'npm run dev'
* Then, on http://localhost:3000/ you can open my app

## Deploy
* https://develops-today-phi.vercel.app/

## Problem
* I have a problem with 'Warning: Prop `className` did not match.'.
* This warning appears when I reload any page in my application.
* Because of this there is some problems with styles.
* I've tried different solutions but nothing helped me (may be it's because I'm using material-ui, but I'm not sure)

## Added features
* Validation (you can't send empty comment or post) - I did it by myself (without Formik or something else), it's not as briliant as i want it to be, but it works
* Notification - post created successfully or not and error with sending comment
